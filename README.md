This is a web-based prescription management system I developed during my second semester as part of my C programming coursework. The project demonstrates practical application of programming concepts learned in class, including file handling, data structures, and user authentication.

## 🎯 What This Project Does

- **Digital Prescription Records**: Replace paper-based prescription management with a digital solution
- **User Login System**: Secure access for both doctors and patients
- **Medicine Database**: Track medicines with dosages, schedules, and expiry dates
- **Role-Based Access**: Different features for administrators (doctors) and regular users (patients)
- **Search & View**: Easy searching and viewing of prescription history

## 🚀 Try It Live

**Demo Credentials for Testing:**

👨‍⚕️ **Doctor/Admin Access:**
- Username: `admin`
- Password: `admin123`
- Can add, view, and delete all prescriptions

👤 **Patient Access:**
- Username: `demo_user`
- Password: `user123`
- Can view only their own prescriptions

## 🎓 Academic Learning Outcomes

This project helped me learn and apply:

- **File Operations**: Reading from and writing to text files for data storage
- **Data Structures**: Using arrays and structures to organize patient and medicine information
- **User Authentication**: Implementing secure login systems
- **Error Handling**: Managing different types of user inputs and system errors
- **Modular Programming**: Breaking down complex problems into smaller, manageable functions
- **Web Integration**: Connecting C programs with modern web interfaces

## 📝 How It Works

1. **Patient Registration**: New users can create accounts through the signup system
2. **Secure Login**: Users authenticate using username and password
3. **Add Prescriptions**: Doctors can add new prescriptions with multiple medicines
4. **View Records**: Users can search and view prescription history
5. **Data Management**: All information is stored in organized text files

## 🎯 Project Structure

- **C Programs**: Core logic for authentication, adding, and managing prescriptions
- **Web Interface**: User-friendly forms and displays for easy interaction
- **Data Storage**: Simple text-based storage system for user and prescription data
